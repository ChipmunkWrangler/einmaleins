I need to improve the funnel. There are the following steps:
1. Discoverability: People need to see the short listing in the app store
2. They need to click on the icon
3. They need to download it
4. They need to review it
5. (if it is not premium, they need to spend money on it).

You should work on improving these in order as far as possible.
OTOH, if you suspect that something is very significant, work on that first, since your low traffic makes it hard to run experiments.

#Discoverability
* Title
* Keywords
* Store ranking
 * In Play Store, this depends on retention?

Unfortunately, I don't know how to monitor this except via Play Store Console...User Acquisition...Acquisition Reports: https://play.google.com/apps/publish/?account=8025892979420536429#AcquisitionPerformancePlace:p=com.crazy_chipmunk.einmaleinspaid&apr=RETAINED_INSTALLERS&apcs=2018-01-13&apce=2018-01-13&apsi=Overall
