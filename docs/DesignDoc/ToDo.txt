====== Bugs ======
* There is a pause on the first quiz question
* Reach mars without answering any questions after upgrade 1 : maybe tweak the planet heights?
* if a wrong question is shown but not answered (because you reach the planet), it is still no longer marked as wrong, hence in the next quiz is doesn't appear first
