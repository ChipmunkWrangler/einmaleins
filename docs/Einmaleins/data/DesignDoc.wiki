+Orbiting is boring, falling is sad 
++Goals
 * Fairly steady progress
 * drill difficult questions
 * don't repeat easy questions
  * assume mastery for questions that are answered very fast right away
 * all questions mastered before reaching pluto
 * don't repeat questions right away
++Approach
 * There is only flash mode, so I will refer to mastered instead of flash-mastered 
 * Each day, you get k launches
 * Each launch ends after N questions or t = N * 6s (3s question answering time plus 3s celebration time), whichever comes first.
  * Do you display this to the player? That would be high-pressure and unnatural, but not showing it might make it feel arbitrary or unfair 
  * *Answering one question quickly gives you more time for the next! Do you want this?* 
   * If you don't, reduce time limit after fast answer. 
   * Then you also don't need the question limit (which is there to limit max attainable height to be the next planet)
 * Each correct answer increases rocket height by a fixed amount H = planetHeight / N
  * So if you answer all questions in the allotted time, you reach the planet 
  * Could also establish a MIN_PLAUSIBLE_ANSWER_TIME and make that the time limit. 
   * Then people have to be very good to reach the planet without an upgrade, and 
   * They are unlikely to get much past the planet
 * Mastering a question gives you a rocket part => upgrade after P => planetHeight for H is increased to next planet
  * Interrupt launch for upgrade *???* 
 * initial answer time is 3.0 + epsilon seconds 
  * Thus, if you answer the question on time first try, it is mastered
 * A question answered wrong has its answer time set to MAX_ANSWER_TIME = 60s 
 * Start with frustration = 0. +2 for wrong answer, -1 for right answer, -2 for fast answer, capped at [-2, 3] 
 * Question ordering:
  * First ask all questions that you got wrong during the last launch.
  * Are there non-new, non-mastered questions available?
   * If so:
    * if frustration <= 0, take the hardest. In practice, this should mean:
     * questions you answered wrong recently
     * Then questions you answered slowly
    * if frustration > 0, take the easiest
   * If not, are there new questions available?
    * If so:
     * if frustration <= 0, take one at random
     * if frustration > 0, take the first (1x1, 1x2...)
   * If not, take a mastered question -- easiest or hardest depending on frustration
   
   
 * After you reach Neptune (which implies that you have 55 questions either mastered or answered fast in this set), do the gauntlet
  * No mastery boost -- mastered questions are treated as normal questions
  * You have 55 * 3 = 165 seconds to answer all questions to reach Pluto.
  * Height += is plutoDistance / 55 per correct answer
  * gauntlet aborts as soon as a question is failed (wrong or requires more than target time)
 * After you reach Pluto, return to 99s limit with thrust = plutoDistance / 33.
  * Since you don't abort or stop at the planet, you go further if you require less than target time
  * This makes it possible to keep breaking records, but doesn't guarantee it
 * Effects:
  * Flash mastery causes a "Mastered!" to appear
  * show simple particles when a question is answered in target time and mastery particles on mastery
  * The rocket engine run from answer through the next question's target time, so if you are on track, they keep firing
+++Variant: Spaced repetition
 * Repeat wrong questions in 5s, right questions in Pimsleur progression
 * No frustration, difficulty, or mastery: Show the question that has been due longest, then new questions in order
 * This doesn't guarantee that all questions will have been seen by Neptune
 * See if this is helpful after writing a test for the answer-time-based version
+++Variant: Boost
 * Upgrade comes when you reach a planet
 * mastered questions from for this planet boost 3x as much as a correct answer and reduce N
  * 3x because that guarantees you need to answer at least 3 post-boost questions to reach the planet (if 3 divides N)
 * Should give smoother progress than upgrade-based 
++Does Approach Match Goals
 * Say P = 11, N = 21, t = 21 * 6 = 126, each planet twice as far as the last, Mars height = 1
 * The results seem to depend on P & N in a way I don't like
 * Is there a natural P and / or N?
 * Perfect kid (always answers correctly in 1.5s, 4.5 with celebration):
  * Masters 11 questions (11/55), gets upgrade, reaches height 11 / 21
  * Masters 11 questions (22/55), reaches Mars, gets upgrade to 4x (Saturn).
  * Masters 11 questions (33/55), reaches Jupiter, gets upgrade to 8x (Uranus)
  * Masters 11 questions (44/55), reaches Saturn, gets upgrade to 16x (Neptune)
  * Masters 11 questions (55/55), reaches Uranus, gets upgrade to 32x (Pluto)
  * Reviews 11 questions, reaches Neptune.
+++Variant: Allow collecting more parts than you need (don't interrupt to upgrade, do interrupt when planet is reached)
 * Perfect kid (always answers correctly in 1.5s, 4.5 with celebration):
  * Masters 21 questions (21/55), reaches Mars, gets upgrade to 2x (Jupiter).
  * Masters 11 questions (32/55), reaches Jupiter, gets upgrade to 4x (Saturn).
  * Masters 11 questions (43/55), reaches Saturn, gets upgrade to 8x (Uranus)
  * Masters 11 questions (54/55), reaches Uranus, upgrade to 16x
  * Masters 1 question, reviews 10, reaches Neptune.

+++Compare to Boost Version
 * Perfect kid:
  * Masters 21 questions (21/55), reaches Mars, gets upgrade to 2x (Jupiter).
  * Masters 21 questions (42/55), reaches Jupiter, gets upgrade to 4 (Saturn).
  * Masters 13 questions (55/55), reviews 8, reaches Saturn, gets upgrade to 8x (Uranus)
  * Reviews 21 questions, reaches Uranus, upgrade to 16x
  * Reviews 21 questions, reaches Neptune.
++++Boost variant
 * mastered questions exceeding the minimum for this planet boost 3x as much as a correct answer and reduce N
 * Need N = 33
 * Perfect kid:
  * Masters 33 questions (33/55), reaches Mars, gets upgrade to 2x (Jupiter).
  * Boost straight to Jupiter (33 - 11 = 22 >= 11), gets upgrade to 4x (Saturn).
  * Boost straight to Saturn (33 - 22 = 11), gets upgrade to 8x (Uranus)
  * Masters 22 questions (55/55), reviews 11, reaches Uranus, upgrade to 16x
  * Boost straight to Neptune (22 - 11 = 11).
 
+Ideas
 * Even mastered skills need occasional review
 * If a card would be shown twice in a row, and there are still cards left or new cards available, move it one back in the list.

  * btw. könntest Du auch die Grafiken in Magica Voxel machen. Kannst Du dann auch sehr simple in Einzelteile zerlegen und Stück für Stück zusammenbauen
  * Then you can set the distances each to 2x prev distance and avoid the math complications and the orbiting 
 * Use red bubble notifications
 * Nicer delete icon
 * particles come out of the stars to make the connection to multipliers (could also move stars under score) 
 * Use a rocket as rocket parts progress bar instead of a number
  * And an engine for upgrades? 
 * Matthias wünscht sich Schrifteingabe
 * Ich wünsche mir Stimmeingabe
 * x3 and x2 resolutions for backgrounds
 * Add tracking of questions posed & answered to see how people play it
 * tutorial with rocket instead of finger? Decide with Talea and other parents what needs a tutorial
 * Parent mode
  * Delete account
  * Reset account
  * Change difficulty level
   * With option to reset flash progress and upgrades, reimbursing rocket parts 
 * bigger rocket on icon (use xcf in unusedassets as base)
 * If you want to make it free and sell it after you have reached Mars: https://developer.apple.com/app-store/parental-gates/
 * Final congratulation with magic tree.
 * Explain the slow last round based on it being a cargo ship for the tree
 * Flash Stats screen with "collected" planets an orbit records?
 * Split saturn into two layers (front of rings & (planet + back of rings) so you can go through the rings
  * Ensure that shadowed, missing part of ring is black, not transparent 
 * More education: See Hints
 * More juice
  * https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/2i1281/adding_juice_a_question_about_squishing_and/
  * https://forum.unity.com/threads/juicebox-add-some-juice-to-your-game.267081/
  * Scene transition in OnPlay (rocket with name on the side?)
  * Celebrate the instant the record is broken in Launch mode: special flames?
  * Screen shake on launch, or on every thrust
 * Show progress bar towards building or upgrading the rocket
 * More involvement with rocket building
  * Kid chooses rocket design and color
  * Choose differently coloured rockets
   * Maybe limit it to a few per day 
  * Choose a new rocket design with every upgrade (or as a separate kind of upgrade that happens at a different pace)
  * Use Inkscape to split your rockets into pieces that you can build.
  * Rocket building screen shows the rocket under construction for the first 10 pieces. You can build it piece by piece
  * Colouring book for rocket
 * Main screen: highlight stats button if there are any unseen improvements (anything that would be yellow)
 * Switch from PlayerPrefs to another system https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/scripting/persistence-saving-and-loading-data
 * Optimize graphics:
   * https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/75376/why-does-unity-in-2d-mode-employ-scaling-and-the-default-othographic-size-the-wa 
   * https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Profiler.html

   * http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/401716/determining-texture-memory-usage.html
 * Make the timed parts a reward. So you are struggling through stuff, and then comes something you know well and have to do fast. The music changes, cool shit happens if you succeed, maybe there's action (have a plane flying that goes up every time you get it within the time limit, for example)
  * Matthias B says: consider visual flow: ATM it starts at the question, then down to the buttons, then up to the answer, down to the rocket, up to the result... he thinks it would be better to go from top to bottom or vice versa

++Collectibles
 * Get a new alien for each planet reached
  * Or a plant
  * Or at least have a collection screen for the planets themselves 
 * Award a collectible animal when a skill is mastered
 * Upgrade the animal or award another when a skill is flash mastered
 * That is 100 - 400 animals (double if 6x8 is not 8x6 -- maybe cheat by adding the same animal in a different color)!
  * That is too many to appreciate anyway.
  * Maybe an animal for mastering all the x1s, all the x2s, etc. That would be 10 - 20.
  * And for each skill, it just lights up gold in the bingo card?
 * After they get the animal, they have to feed the animal:
  * It starts to get hungry when they need to review its skills
  * They can't force the right exercise to come, but they know it will come soon after the animal gets hungry if they play. 
++Algorithm
 * Consider adding a 15 minute cutoff regardless of number of errors
 * Have the option to do extra review in LRU order.
 * The intervals published in Pimsleur's paper were: 5 seconds, 25 seconds, 2 minutes, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 5 hours, 1 day, 5 days, 25 days, 4 months, and 2 years.
 * If there are no cards left to drill, and there is a new card available, and (you have spent less than 5 minutes in the app or have fewer than three mistakes), add a new card.
++Presentation
 * Present the questions both visually and orally
 * Show untimed multiplication as a square of dots (or animals), maybe initially marching out in rows
  * http://www.mathplayground.com/tb_multiplication/thinking_blocks_multiplication_division.html
  * These blocks can be arranged on a 10x10 square, trying to fill it as much as possible 
  * Or pizzas with pepperonis
 * Present the questions and answers in different formats and get children to say which are equivalent, e.g.
  * 6x7, 7x6, 56, a 7 by 6 square, 7 pizzas with six pepperonies each
  * maybe even 3x2x7, 7x7-7, 6x6+6, 5x6+2x6, 5x7+1x7 (and their visual equivalents) 
  * and 7 x ? = 42
  * for Nx8, also Nx10 - Nx2
 * Clock solitaire http://www.timestableclock.com/index.html
 * Show a bunch of numbers and say "which of these are multiples of N"
 * Mnemonic stories: http://www.multiplication.com/student-manager/premium/video-player/84
++Games
 * Maybe a minigame to play with the collected animals?
 * Most math drill games are a game (some simple, some complex, like Tower Math) interrupted by a math question. Sometimes this feels more plausible than others (e.g. tower defense works better than shooter). Maybe you could have something where buying is a main mechanic, and the price is always given as N x M.
 * The alternative is a freely playable game for which you win tickets by solving problems
 * Is there anything better? 
  * A geometry game where knowing N x M is intrinsically important?
  * A lockpicking or safecracking game where the combination is the result
  * A hacking game where you have to disable drones before they hit your city. The sooner you do it, the less destruction.
  * Launch code for rocket
  * Coordinates of moon or stargate (could even offer a choice of problems (all due) to go different places or directions)
  * Alas, the best endless runners are based on flow, which you would interrupt with your questions. So maybe separate it: Play cube race or doodle jump for earned ticket; otherwise play booster rockets which is just solving the math (a glorified progress meter) for high scores. 
 * General problem: You can only sensibly allow the game to be played when at least one fact is due. But then the game might be very short, or if you show all facts, encourage wasting time by reviewing things already known, probably at the expense of the other modes. 
+++Battleship
Battleship where the grid has numbers for x and y and you make your attack by entering x times y and receive a shot by decording x times y.
agar.io where you can eat any equation smaller than you and run from those who are larger

+++Doodle Jump
Doodle jump / cube racer thing where the powerups are digits. Maybe write the question on your ship. Make it easy to hit the digit you want (make it lane-based, slow ship down when digits come) -- if you want, you can include normal obstacles at normal speeds as well.
++++Musings
 * However, this means that the right answer must be repeated, making it recognizable unless all answers are repeated
   * Also, I don't really like multiple choice
    * Could make them fly through individual digits -- that would solve both problems 
   * And the player could hit the wrong answer through lack of coordination
    * Maybe instead of "this number or that" it could be "number or not", and it is easy to control, e.g. only two lanes and plenty of time to switch 
++Hints
 * Always show 5x8 and ask for 40, but if the kid gets it wrong or takes too long, walk them through some tricks (or ask them how they did it)
 * Base hints on player mastery -- if we know they know 6x6, use things based on 6x6.
++Tricks
 * 5s end in 5 or 0
 * 10s end in 0
 * 9s digits add up to 9, and the first digit is one less than the multiplier (3x9 = {(3-1),(10-3)})
 * 3s digits add up to 3, 6 or 9 (but this is more useful for other stuff)
 * Songs or jingles?
 * Focus on 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10. Then you only really have to memorize 6, 7, 8 by 6, 7, 8
 * Hand trick 
 * Take the nearest 5x and add
 * Take the nearest 10x and subtract
 * Remembering squares is useful because whenever you multiply numbers that are separated by two you can simply square the middle number and then subtract one to get the answer.  5x7=6x6-1

+++Dinosaur
You are one of the mighty dinosaurs -- King Dinosaur -- and you have to travel across Pangea to get to a big volcano before it explodes, because if it explodes all the dinosaurs will die.
+++Fairies & Unicorns
+++Plants
When you reach Pluto, there should be a tree with a golden trunk and multicoloured leaves. You have to dig it out carefully to take it somewhere warmer where it can survive. It has magical powers that can save your grandmother or the king or someone.

++Marketing Ideas
 * Bundle chocolate with apps: email us with your address and we will mail you a ritter sport of your choice.
++Advice
 * The WIIFM (What’s In It For Me) principle generally yields the best headlines. Articulate a clear benefit to the prospect. 
 * Specificity usually wins over generality (specific numbers, items). Gun vs. Weapon. 63% vs. Over 50%. There is a headline writing technique known as 4Us (Unique, Ultra Specific, Utilility)
 * In a mature/saturated market it is not enough to simply talk about benefits. You 
must find an angle.

+++Long Descriptions

Schnell, was macht acht mal sieben? Die Einmaleins-Rakete hilft Ihrem Kind, solche Fragen blitzschnell und mühelos zu beantworten. 

Das kann in nur wenigen Minuten am Tag erreicht werden, weil sich die App Ihrem Kind anpasst: Sie merkt, welche Aufgaben dem Kind leicht und schwer fallen, und stellt gezielt die Fragen, die ihn weiterbringen.

Allerdings ist die App (noch) nicht dafür geeignet, Ihrem Kind das Konzept der Multiplikation von Null auf beizubringen. Damit eignet sie sich am Besten für Kinder am Ende der 2. oder Anfang der 3. Klasse.

Quick, what is eight times seven? The Times Table Rocket helps your kid to answer such questions effortlessly, with only a few minutes of practice a day. 

The Rocket doesn't waste your kid's time: it notices which questions your child finds hard or easy, and only drills the tricky ones... unless the kid is getting frustrated from too many wrong answers, in which cases the Rocket tosses a few softballs before getting back to business.

What the Rocket doesn't do (yet) is teach multiplication from scratch. What is will do is take your kid from "I get it... I guess" to "this is easy!"

Hallo Siri,

als die Kinder in diesem Jahr die Aufgabe bekamen, das kleine Einmaleins aus dem Effeff zu können, hat es mich gestört, dass Talea bei den Hausaufgaben viel Zeit mit Fragen verbringen musste, die sich eigentlich schon konnte. Ich habe deswegen eine kleine Übungsapp geschrieben, die sich die Antworten des Kindes merkt und gezielt die schwierigen Fragen in den Vordergrund stellt.

Ich nehme an, dass Lissie inzwischen keinen Bedarf mehr an Einmaleinsübung hat, aber wäre sie bereit, trotzdem die App für mich etwas auszuprobieren und Kritik zu geben?
Liebe Grüße
