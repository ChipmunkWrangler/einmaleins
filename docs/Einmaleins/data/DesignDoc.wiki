+Orbiting is boring, falling is sad 
++Goals
 * Fairly steady progress
  * So if there is a cap on height, and you reach it, it should ideally give you a bonus afterwards
  * New questions should come slowly enough that your natural progress towards mastering existing questions is reflected by height records  
 * drill difficult questions
  * but don't repeat them immediately
 * don't repeat easy questions
  * assume mastery for questions that are answered very fast right away
 * all questions mastered before reaching pluto
  * this probably means forcing mastering of 11 questions before reaching Mars or at least Jupiter, etc. 
 * once all questions are mastered, do the pluto gauntlet? 
 * intuitive but not too punishing sense of urgency
Try a falling and a non-falling version
++Musings
If you don't fall, then either 
 * the distance travelled depend on the speed with which the question is answered, or 
 * each correct answer moves you a fixed distance and there is a time limit
You get smoother progress if there is an advantage to being under the target time. 
 * In particular, if the distance travelled caps at answering within target time, and you reach a planet by answering the correct number of questions in the target time, then you need to upgrade when you reach the planet at the latest, otherwise you can't improve on that result.
  * If reaching the planet causes an upgrade, it should be the only way to get an upgrade, which is bad.
But then you have to cap that advantage to prevent reaching other planets too early.
+++Time Limit vs. Variable Distance
 * Time limit
  * is easily visualizable
  * is easily skinnable
  * doesn't cap max height naturally (need to limit number of questions as well)
 * Falling has a natural metaphor and is intuitively unterstandable with no extra UI
+++Boost vs. Upgrade
Boosts due to mastery provide steady progress, but upgrades are satisfying leaps with cool graphics, so I'd prefer upgrades.

OTOH, without boosts, you get a steady trickle of new questions, which will tend to prevent much progress until the upgrade happens.
But the steady trickle is pedagogically sensible, I think, and prevents asking the same question many times in a row.

++Approach: General
 * There is only flash mode, so I will refer to mastered instead of flash-mastered 
 * Each day, you get k launches
 * initial answer time is 3.0 + epsilon seconds 
  * Thus, if you answer the question on time first try, it is mastered
 * Being faster than the target time is rewarded, but it is impossible to reach planet n without upgrade n. 
 * Start with frustration = 0. +2 for wrong answer, -1 for right answer, -2 for fast answer, capped at [-2, 3] 
 * Question ordering:
  * First ask all questions that you got wrong during the last launch.
    * if frustration <= 0, take the hardest
    * if frustration > 0, take the easiest
  * Are there non-new, non-mastered questions available?
   * If so:
    * if frustration <= 0, take the hardest
    * if frustration > 0, take the easiest
   * If not, are there new questions available?
    * If so:
     * if frustration <= 0, take one at random
     * if frustration > 0, take the first (1x1, 1x2...)
   * If not, take a mastered question -- easiest or hardest depending on frustration


++Approach: Falling
 * Relaunch if you hit Earth again
++Approach: Nonfalling
+++Time limit, fixed height per answer
 * Each correct answer increases rocket height by a fixed amount H = planetHeight[i] / M, at upgrade level i
  * So if you answer each of the first M questions in (on average) the allotted time you reach planet i.
  * But we want it to be impossible to reach planet i+1 with upgrade level i 
 * Mastering a question gives you a rocket part => upgrade after 11 parts
  * We can't just upgrade when reaching a planet, because it is not necessary or sufficient to master questions to reach planets 
  * *Interrupt launch for upgrade?* 
   * *But then increase number of quizzes per day?*
 * So the rhythm should be:
  * Try to reach planet i
  * Reach planet i
  * Get upgrade i+1
  * Try to reach planet i+i
   * or
  * Try to reach planet i
  * Get upgrade i+1
  * Reach planet i
  * Try to reach planet i+i
   * but it could even happen that
  * Try to reach planet i
  * Get upgrade i+1
  * Get upgrade i+2
  * Reach planet i
  * Try to reach planet i+i
 * Each launch ends after whichever comes first:
  * you reach a new planet, or
  * t = M * (allottedTime + celebrationTime) seconds elapse
   * This gives a natural limit: You can't answer more Q = t / celebrationTime questions, so you can't get heigher than QH.
    * maxHeight = QH = (M * (allottedTime + celebrationTime) / celebrationTime)) * planetHeight[i] / M = 
    *           = planetHeight[i] * (allottedTime + celebrationTime) / celebrationTime
    *           = planetHeight[i] * (1 + allottedTime / celebrationTime)
    * We want planetHeight[i+1] > maxHeight = planetHeight[i] * (1 + allottedTime / celebrationTime)
    * planetHeight[i+1] / planetHeight[i] > 1 + allottedTime / celebrationTime
    * celebrationTime > allottedTime / (planetHeight[i+1] / planetHeight[i] - 1)
    * So if the new planet is at least twice as high as the old planet, celebrationTime > allottedTime suffices.
    * For i = 3, celebrationTime > allottedTime / 0.6. So for allottedTime of 3s, celebration must be >= 5s. Or a = 2.5s, c = 4.17
    * For i = 4, celebrationTime > allottedTime / 0.33. This can't be fudged. 
     * But if we add the moon, then i=4 becomes i = 5 and you have mastered all questions
     * So in order to have a shot at reaching Neptune, you must already have mastered all questions
      * But then Neptune is already review, which is Pluto's role
      * That might not be so bad, though, because it is a pre-review that prepares you for the gauntlet
     * Or you only have a shot at Neptune after mastering 44 questions (if there is no moon)
      * And there are only 11 questions left, which could be a natural limit to stop you from getting to Pluto early
      * But as you master some of these 11, there will be too few questions to ask
      * We could fill in with review questions, but then the natural limit is gone
     * Or you switch to the gauntlet as soon as Neptune is reached
      * But then you may not have mastered all questions before targeting Pluto
      * You could switch to the gauntlet with an inadequate engine and offer one more upgrade once you master the last questions
      * But this wastes the player's time   
  * you can add a question limit to stop before the natural time-based limit
   * but this is less transparent for the player
   * Also, the closer N is to M, the less scope there is for breaking records after reaching the planet, while grinding for the upgrade 
   * maxQuestions = N s.t. planetHeight[i+i] > NH
    * => planetHeight[i+i] > N * planetHeight[i] / M 
    * => M * planetHeight[i+1] / planetHeight[i] > N
    * => M * 1.6  > N for i = 3
    * => M * 1.33 > N for i = 4, e.g. M = 11 => N <= 14.
 * Wrong answers tend to take longer, and also only move you up a fraction as high 
 * Display is a problem: Do you display this to the player? Perhaps as fuel? Or oxygen? That would be high-pressure, but not showing it might feel arbitrary
   
   
 * After you reach Neptune (which implies that you have 55 questions either mastered or answered fast in this set), do the gauntlet
  * No mastery boost -- mastered questions are treated as normal questions
  * You have 55 * 3 = 165 seconds to answer all questions to reach Pluto.
  * Height += is plutoDistance / 55 per correct answer
  * gauntlet aborts as soon as a question is failed (wrong or requires more than target time)
 * After you reach Pluto, return to 99s limit with thrust = plutoDistance / 33.
  * Since you don't abort or stop at the planet, you go further if you require less than target time
  * This makes it possible to keep breaking records, but doesn't guarantee it
 * Effects:
  * Flash mastery causes a "Mastered!" to appear
  * After wrong answer, exhaust sputters
  * show simple particles when a question is answered in target time and mastery particles on mastery
  * The rocket engine run from answer through the next question's target time, so if you are on track, they keep firing
+++Question limit, variable height per answer

+++Variant: Spaced repetition
 * Repeat wrong questions in 5s, right questions in Pimsleur progression
 * No frustration, difficulty, or mastery: Show the question that has been due longest, then new questions in order
 * This doesn't guarantee that all questions will have been seen by Neptune
 * See if this is helpful after writing a test for the answer-time-based version

 * The results seem to depend on P & N in a way I don't like
 * Is there a natural P and / or N?


+Ideas
 * Even mastered skills need occasional review
 * If a card would be shown twice in a row, and there are still cards left or new cards available, move it one back in the list.

  * btw. könntest Du auch die Grafiken in Magica Voxel machen. Kannst Du dann auch sehr simple in Einzelteile zerlegen und Stück für Stück zusammenbauen
  * Then you can set the distances each to 2x prev distance and avoid the math complications and the orbiting 
 * Use red bubble notifications
 * Nicer delete icon
 * particles come out of the stars to make the connection to multipliers (could also move stars under score) 
 * Use a rocket as rocket parts progress bar instead of a number
  * And an engine for upgrades? 
 * Matthias wünscht sich Schrifteingabe

  * Change difficulty level
   * With option to reset flash progress and upgrades, reimbursing rocket parts 
 * bigger rocket on icon (use xcf in unusedassets as base)

 * Flash Stats screen with "collected" planets an orbit records?
 * Split saturn into two layers (front of rings & (planet + back of rings) so you can go through the rings
  * Ensure that shadowed, missing part of ring is black, not transparent 
 * More education: See Hints

  * https://forum.unity.com/threads/juicebox-add-some-juice-to-your-game.267081/
  * Scene transition in OnPlay (rocket with name on the side?)
  * Celebrate the instant the record is broken in Launch mode: special flames?
  * Screen shake on launch, or on every thrust
 * Show progress bar towards building or upgrading the rocket
 * More involvement with rocket building
  * Kid chooses rocket design and color
  * Choose differently coloured rockets
   * Maybe limit it to a few per day 
  * Choose a new rocket design with every upgrade (or as a separate kind of upgrade that happens at a different pace)
  * Use Inkscape to split your rockets into pieces that you can build.
  * Rocket building screen shows the rocket under construction for the first 10 pieces. You can build it piece by piece

 * Make the timed parts a reward. So you are struggling through stuff, and then comes something you know well and have to do fast. The music changes, cool shit happens if you succeed, maybe there's action (have a plane flying that goes up every time you get it within the time limit, for example)
  * Matthias B says: consider visual flow: ATM it starts at the question, then down to the buttons, then up to the answer, down to the rocket, up to the result... he thinks it would be better to go from top to bottom or vice versa

++Collectibles
 * Get a new alien for each planet reached
  * Or a plant
  * Or at least have a collection screen for the planets themselves 
 * Award a collectible animal when a skill is mastered
 * Upgrade the animal or award another when a skill is flash mastered
 * That is 100 - 400 animals (double if 6x8 is not 8x6 -- maybe cheat by adding the same animal in a different color)!
  * That is too many to appreciate anyway.
  * Maybe an animal for mastering all the x1s, all the x2s, etc. That would be 10 - 20.
  * And for each skill, it just lights up gold in the bingo card?
 * After they get the animal, they have to feed the animal:
  * It starts to get hungry when they need to review its skills
  * They can't force the right exercise to come, but they know it will come soon after the animal gets hungry if they play. 
++Algorithm
 * Consider adding a 15 minute cutoff regardless of number of errors
 * Have the option to do extra review in LRU order.
 * The intervals published in Pimsleur's paper were: 5 seconds, 25 seconds, 2 minutes, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 5 hours, 1 day, 5 days, 25 days, 4 months, and 2 years.
 * If there are no cards left to drill, and there is a new card available, and (you have spent less than 5 minutes in the app or have fewer than three mistakes), add a new card.
++Presentation
 * Present the questions both visually and orally
 * Show untimed multiplication as a square of dots (or animals), maybe initially marching out in rows
  * http://www.mathplayground.com/tb_multiplication/thinking_blocks_multiplication_division.html
  * These blocks can be arranged on a 10x10 square, trying to fill it as much as possible 
  * Or pizzas with pepperonis
 * Present the questions and answers in different formats and get children to say which are equivalent, e.g.
  * 6x7, 7x6, 56, a 7 by 6 square, 7 pizzas with six pepperonies each
  * maybe even 3x2x7, 7x7-7, 6x6+6, 5x6+2x6, 5x7+1x7 (and their visual equivalents) 
  * and 7 x ? = 42
  * for Nx8, also Nx10 - Nx2
 * Clock solitaire http://www.timestableclock.com/index.html
 * Show a bunch of numbers and say "which of these are multiples of N"
 * Mnemonic stories: http://www.multiplication.com/student-manager/premium/video-player/84
++Games
 * Maybe a minigame to play with the collected animals?
 * Most math drill games are a game (some simple, some complex, like Tower Math) interrupted by a math question. Sometimes this feels more plausible than others (e.g. tower defense works better than shooter). Maybe you could have something where buying is a main mechanic, and the price is always given as N x M.
 * The alternative is a freely playable game for which you win tickets by solving problems
 * Is there anything better? 
  * A geometry game where knowing N x M is intrinsically important?
  * A lockpicking or safecracking game where the combination is the result
  * A hacking game where you have to disable drones before they hit your city. The sooner you do it, the less destruction.
  * Launch code for rocket
  * Coordinates of moon or stargate (could even offer a choice of problems (all due) to go different places or directions)
  * Alas, the best endless runners are based on flow, which you would interrupt with your questions. So maybe separate it: Play cube race or doodle jump for earned ticket; otherwise play booster rockets which is just solving the math (a glorified progress meter) for high scores. 
 * General problem: You can only sensibly allow the game to be played when at least one fact is due. But then the game might be very short, or if you show all facts, encourage wasting time by reviewing things already known, probably at the expense of the other modes. 
+++Battleship
Battleship where the grid has numbers for x and y and you make your attack by entering x times y and receive a shot by decording x times y.
agar.io where you can eat any equation smaller than you and run from those who are larger

+++Doodle Jump
Doodle jump / cube racer thing where the powerups are digits. Maybe write the question on your ship. Make it easy to hit the digit you want (make it lane-based, slow ship down when digits come) -- if you want, you can include normal obstacles at normal speeds as well.
++++Musings
 * However, this means that the right answer must be repeated, making it recognizable unless all answers are repeated
   * Also, I don't really like multiple choice
    * Could make them fly through individual digits -- that would solve both problems 
   * And the player could hit the wrong answer through lack of coordination
    * Maybe instead of "this number or that" it could be "number or not", and it is easy to control, e.g. only two lanes and plenty of time to switch 
++Hints
 * Always show 5x8 and ask for 40, but if the kid gets it wrong or takes too long, walk them through some tricks (or ask them how they did it)
 * Base hints on player mastery -- if we know they know 6x6, use things based on 6x6.
++Tricks
 * 5s end in 5 or 0
 * 10s end in 0
 * 9s digits add up to 9, and the first digit is one less than the multiplier (3x9 = {(3-1),(10-3)})
 * 3s digits add up to 3, 6 or 9 (but this is more useful for other stuff)
 * Songs or jingles?
 * Focus on 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10. Then you only really have to memorize 6, 7, 8 by 6, 7, 8
 * Hand trick 
 * Take the nearest 5x and add
 * Take the nearest 10x and subtract
 * Remembering squares is useful because whenever you multiply numbers that are separated by two you can simply square the middle number and then subtract one to get the answer.  5x7=6x6-1

++Advice
 * The WIIFM (What’s In It For Me) principle generally yields the best headlines. Articulate a clear benefit to the prospect. 
 * Specificity usually wins over generality (specific numbers, items). Gun vs. Weapon. 63% vs. Over 50%. There is a headline writing technique known as 4Us (Unique, Ultra Specific, Utilility)
 * In a mature/saturated market it is not enough to simply talk about benefits. You 
must find an angle.

Schnell, was macht acht mal sieben? Die Einmaleins-Rakete hilft Ihrem Kind, solche Fragen blitzschnell und mühelos zu beantworten. 

Das kann in nur wenigen Minuten am Tag erreicht werden, weil sich die App Ihrem Kind anpasst: Sie merkt, welche Aufgaben dem Kind leicht und schwer fallen, und stellt gezielt die Fragen, die ihn weiterbringen.

Allerdings ist die App (noch) nicht dafür geeignet, Ihrem Kind das Konzept der Multiplikation von Null auf beizubringen. Damit eignet sie sich am Besten für Kinder am Ende der 2. oder Anfang der 3. Klasse.

Quick, what is eight times seven? The Times Table Rocket helps your kid to answer such questions effortlessly, with only a few minutes of practice a day. 

The Rocket doesn't waste your kid's time: it notices which questions your child finds hard or easy, and only drills the tricky ones... unless the kid is getting frustrated from too many wrong answers, in which cases the Rocket tosses a few softballs before getting back to business.

What the Rocket doesn't do (yet) is teach multiplication from scratch. What is will do is take your kid from "I get it... I guess" to "this is easy!"

Hallo Siri,

als die Kinder in diesem Jahr die Aufgabe bekamen, das kleine Einmaleins aus dem Effeff zu können, hat es mich gestört, dass Talea bei den Hausaufgaben viel Zeit mit Fragen verbringen musste, die sich eigentlich schon konnte. Ich habe deswegen eine kleine Übungsapp geschrieben, die sich die Antworten des Kindes merkt und gezielt die schwierigen Fragen in den Vordergrund stellt.

Ich nehme an, dass Lissie inzwischen keinen Bedarf mehr an Einmaleinsübung hat, aber wäre sie bereit, trotzdem die App für mich etwas auszuprobieren und Kritik zu geben?
Liebe Grüße
