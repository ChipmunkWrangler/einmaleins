# Bugs
* If you get a question wrong, but then right quickly, you can instamaster
 * And if you get it wrong, and get it right fast in the next quiz, you can instamaster? WTF? Does this happen because the first answer was nearly fast enough, so the average is low? Maybe increase time penalty for wrong answers? 
* There is a pause on the first quiz question
* Reach mars without answering any questions after upgrade 1 : maybe tweak the planet heights?
* if a wrong question is shown but not answered (because you reach the planet), it is still no longer marked as wrong, hence in the next quiz is doesn't appear first
* ion stream flickers between in front of and behind the planets. But it is also kind of cool.
* rocket parts size and colour not reset on quiz end / abort, so if you reach a planet while getting a rocket part, it stays enlarged.
* Answer is not cleared when you abort the quiz, so if you type at just the right moment, the answer appears over the planet, and then the "Auf zum Pluto" button appears on top of the answer
* rocket button in gauntlet looks odd because the button is faded, but not the rocket image
