 Test: Reaching all planets
 Test: Gauntlet
  Upgrade: Extra fuel tanks
 Test: Postgauntlet
 Test: Reaching planet on last question
 Test: Reaching planet before last question
Maybe prioritize wrong, new, slow, mastered instead of wrong, slow, new, mastered? Then we run through the questions once to find the trickiest, then drill those?

+Orbiting is boring, falling is sad 
++Goals
 * Fairly steady progress
  * So if there is a cap on height, and you reach it, it should ideally give you a bonus afterwards
  * New questions should come slowly enough that your natural progress towards mastering existing questions is reflected by height records  
 * drill difficult questions
  * but don't repeat them immediately
 * don't repeat easy questions
  * assume mastery for questions that are answered very fast right away
 * all questions mastered before reaching pluto
  * this probably means forcing mastering of 11 questions before reaching Mars or at least Jupiter, etc. 
 * intuitive but not too punishing sense of urgency
Try a falling and a non-falling version
++Musings
If you don't fall, then either 
 * the distance travelled depend on the speed with which the question is answered, or 
 * each correct answer moves you a fixed distance and there is a time limit
You get smoother progress if there is an advantage to being under the target time. 
 * In particular, if the distance travelled caps at answering within target time, and you reach a planet by answering the correct number of questions in the target time, then you need to upgrade when you reach the planet at the latest, otherwise you can't improve on that result.
  * If reaching the planet causes an upgrade, it should be the only way to get an upgrade, which is bad.
But then you have to cap that advantage to prevent reaching other planets too early.
+++Time Limit vs. Variable Distance
 * Time limit
  * is easily visualizable
  * is easily skinnable
  * doesn't cap max height naturally (need to limit number of questions as well)
 * Falling has a natural metaphor and is intuitively unterstandable with no extra UI
+++Boost vs. Upgrade
Boosts due to mastery provide steady progress, but upgrades are satisfying leaps with cool graphics, so I'd prefer upgrades.

OTOH, without boosts, you get a steady trickle of new questions, which will tend to prevent much progress until the upgrade happens.
But the steady trickle is pedagogically sensible, I think, and prevents asking the same question many times in a row.

++Approach: General
 * There is only flash mode, so I will refer to mastered instead of flash-mastered 
 * Each day, you get k launches
 * initial answer time is 3.0 + epsilon seconds 
  * Thus, if you answer the question on time first try, it is mastered
 * Being faster than the target time is rewarded, but it is impossible to reach planet n without upgrade n. 
 * Start with frustration = 0. +2 for wrong answer, -1 for right answer, -2 for fast answer, capped at [-2, 3] 
 * Question ordering:
  * First ask all questions that you got wrong during the last launch.
    * if frustration <= 0, take the hardest
    * if frustration > 0, take the easiest
  * Are there non-new, non-mastered questions available?
   * If so:
    * if frustration <= 0, take the hardest
    * if frustration > 0, take the easiest
   * If not, are there new questions available?
    * If so:
     * if frustration <= 0, take one at random
     * if frustration > 0, take the first (1x1, 1x2...)
   * If not, take a mastered question -- easiest or hardest depending on frustration
 * Mastering a question gives you a rocket part => upgrade after 11 parts
  * We can't just upgrade when reaching a planet, because it is not necessary or sufficient to master questions to reach planets 
  * Don't interrupt quiz for upgrade?
 * The player may need to grind upgrades (even i+2!) in order to reach planet i. The harder the questions, the more likely this is.
 * Gauntlet: N = 55
  * *Aborts as soon as a question is failed (wrong or requires more than target time)?*
 * Into space: N normal, planetHeight[max] = 2 * plutoHeight
 * Effects:
  * Flash mastery causes a "Mastered!" to appear
  * show simple particles when a question is answered in target time and mastery particles on mastery
 * N.B. it is possible to not have all questions mastered by the end because you lose mastery in the final quiz.
+++Goals met?
 * OK? Fairly steady progress: 
  * GOOD Cap is asymptotic.
  * BAD As you master questions, new ones are mixed in steadily, so no natural progress.
  * GOOD Upgrade grinding eventually causes leaps in progess.
 * OK drill difficult questions
  * OK but don't repeat them immediately (you never repeat a question within a quiz, and quizzes are always several questions long)
 * OK don't repeat easy questions

++Approach: Falling
 * Relaunch if you hit Earth again
++Approach: Nonfalling
+++Time limit, fixed height per answer
 * The moon is a planet.
 * Each correct answer increases rocket height by a fixed amount H = planetHeight[i] / N, at upgrade level i
  * So if you answer each of the first N questions in (on average) the allotted time you reach planet i.
  * But we want it to be impossible to reach planet i+1 with upgrade level i 
 * A wrong answer reduces the remaining time 
 * Each launch ends after whichever comes first:
  * you reach a new planet, or
  * t = N * (allottedTime + celebrationTime) seconds elapse
   * This gives a natural limit: You can't answer more Q = t / celebrationTime questions, so you can't get heigher than QH.
    * We want planetHeight[i+1] > maxHeight = QH => celebrationTime > allottedTime / (planetHeight[i+1] / planetHeight[i] - 1)
    * For i = 0 through 3, our current celebrationTime == allottedTime suffices.
    * For i = 4, celebrationTime > allottedTime / 0.6. So for allottedTime of 3s, celebration must be >= 5s. Or a = 2.5s, c = 4.17. Ok.
    * At i = 5, we have mastered all questions and have not yet reached Neptune (maybe not other planets either).
     * At this point, it is just review
     * And in fact review has started before this, as soon as numUnmastered < N
     * As soon as we reach Neptune, we switch to the Pluto gauntlet
 * Display time limit as as fuel? Or oxygen?
 * Effects:
  * After wrong answer, exhaust sputters
  * The rocket engine run from answer through the next question's target time, so if you are on track, they keep firing
++++Goals satisfied?
 * OK all questions mastered before reaching pluto
 * OK? intuitive but not too punishing sense of urgency
+++Question limit, variable height per answer
 * Each quiz consists of N questions (can show as fuel indicator) or reaching the target planet
 * Each correct answer increases rocket height by a generalized logistic function H(t)
  * H(t) = planetHeight[i] / N * (m + (M - m)/(( (1 + ( ((m - M)/(m - 1))^v - 1 ) * e^(t-a) ) ^ (1/v)))
  * Where M = max height increase from one question = planetHeight[i+1] / planetHeight[i]
  *       m = min height increase from one question, e.g. 0.1
  *       v is a factor which, as it increases, makes slow answers more effective, e.g. 4
  *       t is the timer required to answer the question
  *       a is the allotted time
  * Then H(a) = planetHeight[i] / N, so if you answer all questions in an average of allotted time, you exactly reach the planet.
  * And H(0) < M * planetHeight[i] / N, so max height for one quiz is < N * H(0) = M * planetHeight[i] = planetHeight[i+1] 
 * A wrong answer consumes fuel, i.e. one less question is asked.
 * To reach Pluto, we need to have mastered all questions.
  * As soon as we have mastered all questions and reached Neptune, we switch to the gauntlet
  * But this could make the upgrade into a downgrade if you reach Neptune first, then get it
   * Well, it has more fuel but less thrust per fuel unit. :-)
  
 * Consider limiting the quizzes per day by time or effort instead of number

+++Goals satisfied?
 * OK all questions mastered before reaching pluto
 * OK? intuitive but not too punishing sense of urgency

+++Variant: Spaced repetition
 * Repeat wrong questions in 5s, right questions in Pimsleur progression
 * No frustration, difficulty, or mastery: Show the question that has been due longest, then new questions in order
 * This doesn't guarantee that all questions will have been seen by Neptune
 * See if this is helpful after writing a test for the answer-time-based version

+Ideas
 * Highlight getting a record, keep it yellow
 * Avoid delay after answering first question by creating and saving questions asynch during rocket building
  * Also QuestionPicker only needs to save one question, not all questions, in OnAnswer 
 * Automatically show stats screen after launch if a new card was mastered
  * Or at least add a big "View progress" above "Launch" button instead of little stats screen button 
  * Fade mastered cards one at a time, show flying "Mastered" text
 * Even mastered skills need occasional review
 * If a card would be shown twice in a row, and there are still cards left or new cards available, move it one back in the list.

 * Use red bubble notifications

  * Scene transition in OnPlay (rocket with name on the side?)
  * Celebrate the instant the record is broken in Launch mode: special flames?
  * Screen shake on launch, or on every thrust
 * Show progress bar towards building or upgrading the rocket
 * More involvement with rocket building
  * Kid chooses rocket design and color
  * Choose differently coloured rockets
   * Maybe limit it to a few per day 
  * Choose a new rocket design with every upgrade (or as a separate kind of upgrade that happens at a different pace)
  * Use Inkscape to split your rockets into pieces that you can build.
  * Rocket building screen shows the rocket under construction for the first 10 pieces. You can build it piece by piece
  * Colouring book for rocket
 * Main screen: highlight stats button if there are any unseen improvements (anything that would be yellow)
 * Switch from PlayerPrefs to another system https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/scripting/persistence-saving-and-loading-data
 * Optimize graphics:

   * http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/401716/determining-texture-memory-usage.html
 * Make the timed parts a reward. So you are struggling through stuff, and then comes something you know well and have to do fast. The music changes, cool shit happens if you succeed, maybe there's action (have a plane flying that goes up every time you get it within the time limit, for example)
  * Matthias B says: consider visual flow: ATM it starts at the question, then down to the buttons, then up to the answer, down to the rocket, up to the result... he thinks it would be better to go from top to bottom or vice versa

++Collectibles
 * Get a new alien for each planet reached
  * Or a plant
  * Or at least have a collection screen for the planets themselves 
 * Award a collectible animal when a skill is mastered
 * Upgrade the animal or award another when a skill is flash mastered
 * That is 100 - 400 animals (double if 6x8 is not 8x6 -- maybe cheat by adding the same animal in a different color)!
  * That is too many to appreciate anyway.
  * Maybe an animal for mastering all the x1s, all the x2s, etc. That would be 10 - 20.
  * And for each skill, it just lights up gold in the bingo card?
 * After they get the animal, they have to feed the animal:
  * It starts to get hungry when they need to review its skills
  * They can't force the right exercise to come, but they know it will come soon after the animal gets hungry if they play. 
++Algorithm
 * Consider adding a 15 minute cutoff regardless of number of errors
 * Have the option to do extra review in LRU order.
 * The intervals published in Pimsleur's paper were: 5 seconds, 25 seconds, 2 minutes, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 5 hours, 1 day, 5 days, 25 days, 4 months, and 2 years.
 * If there are no cards left to drill, and there is a new card available, and (you have spent less than 5 minutes in the app or have fewer than three mistakes), add a new card.
++Presentation
 * Present the questions both visually and orally
 * Show untimed multiplication as a square of dots (or animals), maybe initially marching out in rows
  * http://www.mathplayground.com/tb_multiplication/thinking_blocks_multiplication_division.html
  * These blocks can be arranged on a 10x10 square, trying to fill it as much as possible 
  * Or pizzas with pepperonis
 * Present the questions and answers in different formats and get children to say which are equivalent, e.g.
  * 6x7, 7x6, 56, a 7 by 6 square, 7 pizzas with six pepperonies each
  * maybe even 3x2x7, 7x7-7, 6x6+6, 5x6+2x6, 5x7+1x7 (and their visual equivalents) 
  * and 7 x ? = 42
  * for Nx8, also Nx10 - Nx2
 * Clock solitaire http://www.timestableclock.com/index.html
 * Show a bunch of numbers and say "which of these are multiples of N"
 * Mnemonic stories: http://www.multiplication.com/student-manager/premium/video-player/84
++Games
 * Maybe a minigame to play with the collected animals?
 * Most math drill games are a game (some simple, some complex, like Tower Math) interrupted by a math question. Sometimes this feels more plausible than others (e.g. tower defense works better than shooter). Maybe you could have something where buying is a main mechanic, and the price is always given as N x M.
 * The alternative is a freely playable game for which you win tickets by solving problems
 * Is there anything better? 
  * A geometry game where knowing N x M is intrinsically important?
  * A lockpicking or safecracking game where the combination is the result
  * A hacking game where you have to disable drones before they hit your city. The sooner you do it, the less destruction.
  * Launch code for rocket
  * Coordinates of moon or stargate (could even offer a choice of problems (all due) to go different places or directions)
  * Alas, the best endless runners are based on flow, which you would interrupt with your questions. So maybe separate it: Play cube race or doodle jump for earned ticket; otherwise play booster rockets which is just solving the math (a glorified progress meter) for high scores. 
 * General problem: You can only sensibly allow the game to be played when at least one fact is due. But then the game might be very short, or if you show all facts, encourage wasting time by reviewing things already known, probably at the expense of the other modes. 
+++Battleship
Battleship where the grid has numbers for x and y and you make your attack by entering x times y and receive a shot by decording x times y.
agar.io where you can eat any equation smaller than you and run from those who are larger

+++Doodle Jump
Doodle jump / cube racer thing where the powerups are digits. Maybe write the question on your ship. Make it easy to hit the digit you want (make it lane-based, slow ship down when digits come) -- if you want, you can include normal obstacles at normal speeds as well.
++++Musings
 * However, this means that the right answer must be repeated, making it recognizable unless all answers are repeated
   * Also, I don't really like multiple choice
    * Could make them fly through individual digits -- that would solve both problems 
   * And the player could hit the wrong answer through lack of coordination
    * Maybe instead of "this number or that" it could be "number or not", and it is easy to control, e.g. only two lanes and plenty of time to switch 
++Hints
 * Always show 5x8 and ask for 40, but if the kid gets it wrong or takes too long, walk them through some tricks (or ask them how they did it)
 * Base hints on player mastery -- if we know they know 6x6, use things based on 6x6.
++Tricks
 * 5s end in 5 or 0
 * 10s end in 0
 * 9s digits add up to 9, and the first digit is one less than the multiplier (3x9 = {(3-1),(10-3)})
 * 3s digits add up to 3, 6 or 9 (but this is more useful for other stuff)
 * Songs or jingles?
 * Focus on 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10. Then you only really have to memorize 6, 7, 8 by 6, 7, 8
 * Hand trick 
 * Take the nearest 5x and add
 * Take the nearest 10x and subtract
 * Remembering squares is useful because whenever you multiply numbers that are separated by two you can simply square the middle number and then subtract one to get the answer.  5x7=6x6-1

 * The WIIFM (What’s In It For Me) principle generally yields the best headlines. Articulate a clear benefit to the prospect. 
 * Specificity usually wins over generality (specific numbers, items). Gun vs. Weapon. 63% vs. Over 50%. There is a headline writing technique known as 4Us (Unique, Ultra Specific, Utilility)
 * In a mature/saturated market it is not enough to simply talk about benefits. You

Schnell, was macht acht mal sieben? Die Einmaleins-Rakete hilft Ihrem Kind, solche Fragen blitzschnell und mühelos zu beantworten. 

Das kann in nur wenigen Minuten am Tag erreicht werden, weil sich die App Ihrem Kind anpasst: Sie merkt, welche Aufgaben dem Kind leicht und schwer fallen, und stellt gezielt die Fragen, die ihn weiterbringen.

Allerdings ist die App (noch) nicht dafür geeignet, Ihrem Kind das Konzept der Multiplikation von Null auf beizubringen. Damit eignet sie sich am Besten für Kinder am Ende der 2. oder Anfang der 3. Klasse.

Quick, what is eight times seven? The Times Table Rocket helps your kid to answer such questions effortlessly, with only a few minutes of practice a day. 

The Rocket doesn't waste your kid's time: it notices which questions your child finds hard or easy, and only drills the tricky ones... unless the kid is getting frustrated from too many wrong answers, in which cases the Rocket tosses a few softballs before getting back to business.

What the Rocket doesn't do (yet) is teach multiplication from scratch. What is will do is take your kid from "I get it... I guess" to "this is easy!"

Hallo Siri,

als die Kinder in diesem Jahr die Aufgabe bekamen, das kleine Einmaleins aus dem Effeff zu können, hat es mich gestört, dass Talea bei den Hausaufgaben viel Zeit mit Fragen verbringen musste, die sich eigentlich schon konnte. Ich habe deswegen eine kleine Übungsapp geschrieben, die sich die Antworten des Kindes merkt und gezielt die schwierigen Fragen in den Vordergrund stellt.

Ich nehme an, dass Lissie inzwischen keinen Bedarf mehr an Einmaleinsübung hat, aber wäre sie bereit, trotzdem die App für mich etwas auszuprobieren und Kritik zu geben?
Liebe Grüße
