I need to improve the funnel. There are the following steps:
1. Discoverability: People need to see the short listing in the app store
2. They need to click on the icon
3. They need to download it
4. They need to review it
5. (if it is not premium, they need to spend money on it).

You should work on improving these in order as far as possible.
OTOH, if you suspect that something is very significant, work on that first, since your low traffic makes it hard to run experiments.

Note that apps which immediately crash are not allowed -- some minimum functionality would be required for testing purposes.

#Discoverability
* Title
* Keywords
* Ads
* Store ranking https://moz.com/blog/app-store-rankings-formula-deconstructed-in-5-mad-science-experiments
 * In Play Store, this depends on retention?
 * And popularity
  * Talk to schools, parents, etc. in person to increase volume 
 * and update frequency?
 * and rating?
 * number of ratings? But this could be reverse causation
 * number of installs? Or the reverse, again
 * Use machine learning to find best icons or descriptions? API https://itunes.apple.com/search?country=us&entity=software&term=times
* License / Brand
 * Talk to Ravensburger 

Unfortunately, I don't know how to monitor this except via Play Store Console...User Acquisition...Acquisition Reports: https://play.google.com/apps/publish/?account=8025892979420536429#AcquisitionPerformancePlace:p=com.crazy_chipmunk.einmaleinspaid&apr=RETAINED_INSTALLERS&apcs=2018-01-13&apce=2018-01-13&apsi=Overall
which shows visitors, which is Discoverability * Clickability.

#Clickability
* Name: Solarithmetic: Times Tables Math Learning Game
* Icon
 * Google lets you split-test this
 * But you haven't enough users, so just try submitting another app with a different icon? But no reviews then
 * Test with market research company? More expensive, faster. Demographic?
 * Brainstorming:
  * Clash of Clans face
  * Rocket with face
  * Cheery colours
  * Rounded background (see other play store icons)
  * Show 1x1 on the icon itself
* Price
 * Setting it to free did not increase number of visitors (but there may be confounding factors; e.g. perhaps I was higher up the list when not free). We are currently back to original price, so we can compare that to earlier original price weeks to try to extract counfounding issues. 
 * At â‚¬2,89 you got two downloads between Dec 26th and Jan 16th. At free, you got two between Jan 17th and Jan 24th. 
 * Try 0.99$
* Star rating
 * Ask Bob and Filklist

#Downloadability
* Description
* Localization
 * Check your visitor stats by country in Play Store and localize to the relevant languages
* Reviews
