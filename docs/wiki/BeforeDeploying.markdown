# Before deploying
 * Update MDVersion to handle previous version
 * Update build and/or version numbers (Android & iOS build settings + testflight & google play)
  * Changing the version number to something other than 0.1.x seems to cause an Invalid Signature complaint when uploaded
   * It complains that it is not a distribution certificate, which is true -- it is a developer certificate
   * Maybe 0.2 needs to be marked as "Test Flight" instead of "Release" somehow?  
 * use xARM to test the devices with the highest resolution, smallest & largest height & width, and extreme aspect ratios 16:9 and 4:3
 * Ensure that screenshots / video are up to date
  * Add grid button screenshots for small devices
 * Update Noun Project credits 
 * Test on device by changing bundle id to einmaleins2
 * Tag version in git
 * Change bundle id back to einmaleins
